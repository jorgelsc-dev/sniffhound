"""Minimal pure-Python Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matcher.

Exists so `sniffhound.monitors.evaluate_packet` can check tens of thousands
of `payload_contains` literals against one packet's text in a single pass
over that text, instead of one `needle in haystack` scan per monitor - the
same reason real IDS engines (Suricata/Snort) use a multi-pattern matcher
for their "fast pattern" content keyword. No third-party dependency (see
CLAUDE.md's near-zero-dependency policy) - this is a straightforward,
well-known construction: a trie of the patterns plus failure links so a
mismatch resumes from the longest matching suffix instead of restarting.

Only presence ("which of these patterns occur anywhere in this text") is
needed here, not positions, so `search` returns a set of matched pattern
strings.
